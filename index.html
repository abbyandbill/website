              <p>Hello readers! </p><br>
              <p>This blog contains photos of Abby, Bill, and their time together. It was created as a "birthday surprise" for Abby in 2021, and will be updated periodically going forward. We met on Feb 7, 2017 in Ithaca NY while both attending grad school at Cornell, and have been happily together since. Below are links to navigate to photos from a particular year.

                Currently, Abby works as a consultant in Washington, DC. In her spare time, she visits alpaca farms, paints, and goes on walks. Bill is writing his PhD dissertation on earthquake physics, and prepping for his next stint as an algorithmic trader in Chicago.

                This would be the first and only summer where both of us were at Cornell. We spent weekends doing hikes and short getaway trips. <br>
                Walking around after dinner at the shores of Senecca Lake. We went to the same seafood restaurant after nearly every hike at Watkins Glen. 05/20 <br>
                Bikeride around the Onondaga Lake in Syracuse. Abby styled this photo after some Taiwanese drama that I have not seen; pretty neat stuff. 06/11 <br>
                Took a short trip to Boston. This was taken near Charles River. We walked the freedom trail in the blistering summer heat, thinking about how fragile American democracy has become. Jk...more likely planning what seafood restaurant or icecream to try next. <br>
                Took a trip to the Adirondacks, a few hours north from Ithaca. There are about 40 peaks >4000 feet, and we had done ~3 of them. 07/09

                Bill's first trip to Abby's hometown, HK! He was graciously hosted by Abby, Greg, and their parents. They had probably taken him to many fancy restaurants, yet to this day he occasionally thinks about the chicken noodles steamed with seafood on that steamy, summer night (If Abby's parents ever read this they might just stop planning meals for my future visits..). Bill had actually been to HK a few times during high school to take his SATs, but this time he got to enjoy the city more and met up with many of Abby's childhood friends. The two photos were taken at Victoria Harbor and the island of Cheung Chau. 08/18 <br>
                Autumn is the Ithaca's best season. Nice temperatures, turning leaves, and usually weeks away from the heavier TA duties or conferences. 09/17 <br>
                We went for another Adirondacks hike during fall break. 10/06

                Abby visits Bill's hometown, Beijing! Despite harsh winter weather, we managed to site-see during the day, and got dinner every night with Bill's parents. This is 冰糖葫芦, many spherical hawthorn fruit coated with sugar then strung together on a wooden stick. 01/08 <br>
                We also visited 前门 near center city, a historic walking street filled with antique shops and food (including one of the first 全聚德 joints). 01/09 <br>
                Celebrating CNY in Ithaca. We made dumplings from scratch, which was quite the undertaking. The dumpling skin was made from flour, whereas the mix combined ground pork with chives. 02/16 <br>

                Greg visits again! We spent some time in Ithaca before a night in NYC, and then to California! I must mention our memorable evening with an Airbnb host whose name I shall not mention but rhymes with hell. The three of us booked a private bedroom, only to be told that the company had somehow overbooked and our only option (it was 10pm when we arrived) was to sleep in the living room. The only catch was that our host had no where else to sleep that night and would therefore sleep in the same living quarter as us. There are other details which are a bit much for this blog so I won't mention them. But there is a silver lining: after writing to Airbnb they gave us a refund. 03/30 <br>
                We quickly forgot about our lovely host when we landed in sunny CA. Greg showed us around San Diego (late-night taco runs, some beach in La Jolla, campus tours of UCSD, etc) 03/31 <br>
                After spending the weekend together, Greg goes back to school and we journey towards the Bay area, passing LA along the way. Abby took a nice photo in front the Paul Smith pink wall. 04/02 <br>

                Another yearly tradition lives on <span>&#8212;</span> meetup with Bill's college friends in a lakehouse near Lake Erie. We usually play games, drink a little, and watch some movies. Abby was pictured here taking a break from stand-up paddleboarding. 05/26 <br>
                This summer Abby interned at McKinsey's NYC office, and they helped her take a very pretty photo for her badge. For a couple of months, we did lots of commuting between NYC and Ithaca, usually by the BRB (which has since shut down), and got to know the city a lot better. 06/15 <br>
                This will be my future pose for a company ID photo, with the exact piece of dimsum as the prop. JK! In many of my visits, we got dimsum and chacanting in the Manhattan Chinatown. It is worth noting how this place took the effort to house the piece of fried chicken inside a miniature metal cart! The 3 photos were taken 06/17, 07/29, 07/28 <br>
                Abby's childhood friend Gigi took a trip to the US early summer. This was them in Brooklyn. 06/01

                I finally made it to Homecoming during my 4th year at Cornell! We went on the farris wheel during the day and saw fireworks at night. 09/22 <br>
                Abby was blessed with a cookie recipe from an Airbnb host (not the one whose name rhymes with hell) and jumpstarted her baking career. She would make around 30 or so chocolate chip cookies each time, and it would take me < 2 days to finish them. 09/27 <br>
                This year, for some reason I can't remember, we really wanted to see foliage earlier than one could in Ithaca (which usually happens mid-late October). To our knowledge one surefire way to do that is to drive north. So we actually went 4 hours north of Toronto <span>&#8212;</span> Algonquin Provincial Park in ON, Canada. How aboot that? We were rewarded with a breathtaking panorama after a long hike. It (nearly?) makes all the driving worth it. 10/07 <br>

                Bill visits HK again! If I didn't know this before, I do now <span>&#8212;</span> there is no better season to visit HK than wintertime. The only catch was that we flew back together, so every day my sole focus after ~4pm was to stay awake/sharp in front Abby's parents, who spoke a dialect (Cantonese) I can barely understand in the first place. Let it be shown on record that I peaked at my birthday-gift-giving game this winter. I had someone in Ithaca carve Abby's father's name into a golf putt made out of ceramic/marble. To show his appreciation, Mr Yip took me to my favorite HK restaurant: the chicken noodles! If you carefully read your way through you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Bill left just before Christmas for Beijing.

                2019 got off to a snowy start. Entrance to the apartment was covered in salt particles from the boots, and digging out the cars became part of our routine. This would be Abby's final semester at Cornell. Bill started the year after deciding to give up on academia and started preparing for quantitative finance interviews. 01/21 <br>
                For Abby's birthday, I used credit card points to buy us plane tickets to Oahu! We both celebrated a break from Ithaca and got on an 8-hour direct flight to Honolulu. A few of the memorable hikes we went on were Kuli'ou'ou Ridge 02/23, Koko Crater 02/24, and Diamond Head (not shown here). During Koko Crater, Abby climbed 80% of the stairs before telling me to go on without her (3rd panel). Eventually she powered through and we were both rewarded with a breathtaking view featuring the island with the ocean as the backdrop. This is what makes Hawaiian hikes stand out from ones in national parks that we've done in the Continental US: the smell of ocean air at the apex. Temperatures would also cool down quite a bit, given the change in altitude. Our intensive hiking routine justified our many massages. Pictured was a particularly stylish massage room with a view. Our Airbnb host graciously gave us a big discount after we fought honorably against the ants in the room. After a few memorable days, we packed our bags and headed back to Ithaca. We both were dying to get back to our snow shoveling routines (not!). <br>

                To this day Bill maintains a neutral-positive outlook on his time in college. But for some reason, we would make a yearly pilgrammage back to Swarthmore. On this year's trip, we had exhausted any sight-seeing opporunities from previous visits, so we simply studied in the engineering library (named Cornell btw) and Abby's battle with a grape is captured a cute video below. <br>
                The semester was special being Abby's last and marking the start of us going long-distance. But the process was every bit as eventful. We spent a lot of time planning to show Abby's parents around DC and NYC, as well as the final graduation weekend in Ithaca (we had a Google sheet and all). Bill volunteered to cook for Abby's parents, since it's the least he could do to repay them for all the chicken noodle and fancy dining they took him to during his HK visits. He decided to make steak and salmon for Mr and Ms Yip, respectively, and spent the whole semester perfecting his craft, but still managed to overcook the steak in the end (lol). <br>
                This is our entourage on the Brooklyn bridge 05/23 and the Newman overlook at Cornell 05/24. Two days later, we all watched with pride and sweat beads as Abby put on her PhD gown and received her well-deserved diploma. I snatched a picture of Mr Yip taking a picture of Abby, with Greg making a funny face on the side. 05/26 <br>
                After this ~10 day trip, Bill parted ways with the Yips at the Newark airport and started his summer internship at a startup hedge fund while Abby went home with her family for a short break before Greg's graduation and her exciting new job at Mercer in DC. In 2 short weeks, the entourage would be back at it for Greg's graduation from UCSD! What a time to be a Yip parent. Two prestigous degrees collected within 2 weeks woohoo. 06/16 <br>

                After Greg's graduation, the Yips finally got some alone time from Bill and took a trip to Sequoia National Park. Sequoia trees are quite tall, as you can see. 06/19 <br>
                Abby began her job as an associate on the Workforce Strategy & Analytics team at Mercer sometime in July. Here she is showing Bill around her office. 07/17 <br>
                In the fall semester, we'd commute back and forth between Ithaca and DC. The trips were made a lot easier after Bill started to carpool with his labmate, which also made for some interesting discussions on China and Taiwan. For Thanksgiving, we went to Zion with Bill's good friend from college and soon realized this is where the Macbook's default background photo was from. Holy cow. One of our most memorable hikes was to the Narrows. A day before the hike there was a huge snowstorm, which meant the bus that took us to the hike could only drop us off 4 miles away. So we hiked through the snow in our drysuits just to get the Narrows. Walking through the river and not being able to see your steps is quite a tall order. But we managed to live and tell the tale. 11/28 <br>
                We ended the year in DC. Bill's mom came to visit, so we were treated to some delicious homecooked meals for a couple of weeks. Here is a photo of Abby during our walk around the US Capitol. 12/28

                For Abby's birthday, we went to throw axes in Syracuse. The axe itself is about 5 lbs, and the trick to throwing well is to pin down a routine and stay consistent. We eventually both got a bull's eye. For a video of one of Abby's throw see below. <br>
                Rising Covid cases halted the US economy, but not the DC cherry blossoms at tidal basin. A year later as I'm typing this blog and we can finally see light at the end of the tunnel, the cherry blossoms are just a month away. 03/14 <br>
                During the lockdown, one of the few highlights for us was the wedding of Tayler and Tyler. Tayler and Abby had been friends for most of grad school. We had gotten to know them better through sushi dates in Miyaki and Sumo and were excited to be a part of their hybrid wedding, in the backyard of Tyler's parents in Elmira and joined remoted by friends around the world. After the ceremony, we ordered our go-to meal (sushi of course) and took this photo. 06/21 <br>
                As Bill finished his internship and moved to DC for his final year of grad school, we now call home a cozy little studio in DuPont circle. Greg's annual pilgrimage to Abby back in March got canceled due to Covid, so instead he came for two short visits in the fall. Here are the siblings at tidal basin, on a chill autumn day. 10/01 <br>
                We eventually discovered the Mt. Vernon trail, a scenic route along the Potomac River extending from Rosslyn past Alexandria. We would rent a bike and ride for a couple of hours before heading back. 11/14 <br>

                For Thanksgiving this year, we chose to go visit Philly over Virginia Beach with Greg. This is mainly because Greg had never visited Philly, and only in small part because of Bill's urge to revisit his alma mater. We ended up getting takeout from many interesting restaurants while holed up in a nice little apartment just south of Downtown. During the trip Greg was diligently studying for O-chem, which he eventually did very well on. And during one of our walks to the Philly art museum we got a photo on Ben Franklin Pkwy. Bill made an effort to take a photo of the boathouses at night (they're decorated by LED lights and look very pretty), but some road was blocked so he couldn't get the photo. Maybe this is enough reason to revisit? 11/28 <br>
                The last trip of the year we took was to Petersburg, WV. We did a few hikes, had a scare when our Honda Civic got stuck in snow on a mountain, and made s'mores by the fire with a couple of friends. It was a timely gettaway after a pretty ordinary stay-at-home Christmas. 12/27
