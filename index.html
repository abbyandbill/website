              <p>Hello readers! </p>
              <p>This blog contains photos of Abby, Bill, and their time together. It was created as a "birthday surprise" for Abby in 2021, and will be updated periodically going forward. We met on Feb 7, 2017 in Ithaca NY while both attending grad school at Cornell, and have been happily together since. Below are links to navigate to photos from a particular year.

                Currently, Abby works as a consultant in Washington, DC. In her spare time, she visits alpaca farms, paints, and goes on walks. Bill is writing his PhD dissertation on earthquake physics, and prepping for his next stint as an algorithmic trader in Chicago.

                This would be the first and only summer where both of us were at Cornell. We spent weekends doing hikes and short getaway trips. <br>
                Walking around after dinner at the shores of Senecca Lake. We went to the same seafood restaurant after nearly every hike at Watkins Glen. 05/20 <br>
                Bikeride around the Onondaga Lake in Syracuse. Abby styled this photo after some Taiwanese drama that I have not seen; pretty neat stuff. 06/11 <br>
                Took a short trip to Boston. This was taken near Charles River. We walked the freedom trail in the blistering summer heat, thinking about how fragile American democracy has become. Jk...more likely planning what seafood restaurant or icecream to try next. <br>
                Took a trip to the Adirondacks, a few hours north from Ithaca. There are about 40 peaks >4000 feet, and we had done ~2-3 of them. 07/09

                Bill's first trip to Abby's hometown, HK! He was graciously hosted by Abby, Greg, and their parents. They had probably taken him to many fine dining restaurants, yet to this day he occasionally thinks about the chicken noodles steamed with seafood on that steamy, summer night (If Abby's parents ever read this they might just stopping taking me to fancy restaurants in future visits..). Bill had actually been to HK a few times during high school to take his SATs, but this time he got to enjoy the city more and met up with many of Abby's childhood friends. The two photos were taken at Victoria Harbor and the island of Cheung Chau. 08/18 <br>
                Autumn is the Ithaca's best season. Nice temperatures, turning leaves, and usually weeks away from the heavier TA duties or conferences. 09/17 <br>
                We went for another Adirondacks hike during fall break. 10/06

                Abby visits Bill's hometown, Beijing! Despite harsh winter weather, we managed to site-see during the day, and got dinner every night with Bill's parents. This is 冰糖葫芦, spherical hawthorn fruit coated with sugar. 01/08 <br>
                前门 near center city, a historic walking street filled with antique shops and food (including one of the first 全聚德 joints). 01/09 <br>
                Celebrating CNY in Ithaca. We made dumplings from scratch, which is quite the undertaking. The dumpling skin was made from flour, whereas the mix combined ground pork with chives. 02/16 <br>

                Greg visits again! We spent some time in Ithaca before a night in NYC, and then to California! I must mention our memorable evening with an Airbnb host whose name I shall not mention but rhymes with Hell. That's right. The three of us booked a private bedroom, only to be told the website had somehow overbooked and the only option (it was 10pm when we arrived) was to sleep in the living room. The only catch was that our host had no where else to sleep that night and would therefore sleep in the same living quarter as us. There are other details which are a bit too much for this blog so I won't mention. But there is a silver lining: after writing to Airbnb they gave us a refund. 03/30 <br>
                We quickly forgot about our lovely host when we landed in sunny CA. Greg showed us around San Diego (I remember late-night taco runs, some beach in La Jolla, campus tours of UCSD, etc) 03/31 <br>
                After spending the weekend together, Greg goes back to school and we journey towards the Bay area, passing LA along the way. Abby took a nice photo in front the Paul Smith pink wall. 04/02 <br>

                Another yearly tradition lives on <span>&#8212;</span> meetup with Bill's college friends in a lakehouse near Lake Erie. We usually play games, drink a little, and watch some movies. Abby was taking a break from stand-up paddleboarding. 05/26 <br>
                This summer Abby interned at McKinsey's NYC office, and they helped her take a very pretty photo for her badge. This summer we did lots of commuting between NYC and Ithaca, usually by the BRB (which has since shut down), and got to know the city a lot better. 06/15 <br>
                This will be my future pose for a company badge photo, with the exact piece of dimsum as the prop. JK! In many of my visits, we will get dimsum and chacanting in the Manhattan Chinatown. It is worth noting how this place took the effort to house the piece of fried chieck inside a metal cart! The 3 photos were taken 06/17, 07/29, 07/28 <br>
                Abby's childhood friend Gigi took a trip to the US early summer. This was them in Brooklyn. 06/01

                I finally made it to homecoming my 4th year at Cornell! We went on the farris wheel during the day and saw the fireworks at night. 09/22 <br>
                Abby was blessed with a cookie recipe from one gracious Airbnb host (not the one whose name rhymes with hell) and jumpstarted her baking career. She would make around 30 or so each time, and it would take me < 2 days to finish them. 09/27 <br>
                This year, for some reason I can't remember, we really wanted to see foliage earlier than one could in Ithaca. To our knowledge one surefire way to do that is to drive north. So we actually went 4 hours north of Toronto <span>&#8212;</span> Algonquin Provincial Park in ON, Canada. How aboot that? We were rewarded with a breathtaking panorama after a long hike. It (nearly?) makes all the driving worth it. 10/07 <br>

                Bill visits HK again! If I didn't know this before, I do now <span>&#8212;</span> there is no better season to visit HK than wintertime. The only catch was that we flew back together this time, so every day my sole focus after ~4pm was to stay away/sharp in front Abby's parents, who spoke a dialect (Cantonese) I can barely understand in the first place. Let it be shown on record I peaked at my birthday gift giving game this winter. I had someone in Ithaca carve Abby's father name into a golf putt made of marble. To show his appreciation, he took me to my favorite HK restaurant: the chicken noodles! If you carefully read your way through you'll know what I'm talking about. Bill left just before Christmas to visit his own parents.
