              <p>Hello readers! This blog contains photos of Abby, Bill, and their time together. It was created as a "birthday surprise" for Abby in 2021, and will be updated periodically going forward. They met on Feb 7, 2017 in Ithaca NY while both attending grad school at Cornell, and have been together happily since. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, Abby works as a consultant in Washington, DC. In her spare time, she visits alpaca farms, paints, and goes on walks. Bill is writing his PhD dissertation on earthquake physics, and prepping for his next stint as an algorithmic trader. They post occasionally on social media.
              </p>

                Deciding it was too soon to show his true colors, Bill would sometimes bring his work to Abby's office in MVR, leading to this deceptive caption. 02/22<br><br>

                Our first dance together ("Grad ball") in the Johnson Art museum. Gave us an opportunity to wear nice clothes, something that doesn't too much for grad students. 05/07

                This would be the first and only summer where both of us were at Cornell. We spent weekends doing hikes and short getaway trips. <br>
                Walking around after dinner at the shores of Senecca Lake. We went to the same seafood restaurant after nearly every hike at Watkins Glen. 05/20 <br>
                Bikeride around the Onondaga Lake in Syracuse. Abby styled this photo after some Taiwanese drama that I have not seen; pretty neat stuff. 06/11 <br>
                Took a short trip to Boston. This was taken near Charles River. We walked the freedom trail in the blistering summer heat, thinking about how fragile American democracy has become. Jk...more likely planning what seafood restaurant or icecream to try next. <br>
                Took a trip to the Adirondacks, a few hours north from Ithaca. There are about 40 peaks >4000 feet, and we had done ~2-3 of them. 07/09

                Bill's first trip to Abby's hometown, HK! He was graciously hosted by Abby, Greg, and their parents. They had probably taken him to many fine dining restaurants, yet to this day he occasionally thinks about the chicken noodles steamed with seafood on that steamy, summer night. Bill had actually been to HK a few times during high school to take his SATs, but this time he got to enjoy the city more and met up with many of Abby's childhood friends. The two photos were taken at Victoria Harbor and the island of Cheung Chau. 08/18 <br>
                Autumn is the Ithaca's best season. Nice temperatures, turning leaves, and usually weeks away from heavy TA duties or conferences. 09/17 <br>
                We went for another Adirondacks hike during fall break. 10/06

                We went to New Orleans for thanksgiving with some of Bill's friends from college. We strolled on Bourbon St at night to experience the local culture, ate beignets, did a bunch of tourist stuff, and had thanksgiving dinner on the Mississippi river. 11/30 <br>
                Our last trip together this year was to NYC. 12/18
